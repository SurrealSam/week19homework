# Random user viewer/sorter/filter

**Description**

This app generates 200 random users, displays them, then allows you to sort and filter them as you choose

**Future improvements**

I would like the reorganize my filtering process on the page. It is somewhat unintuitive and could be much better. The backend functions are solid though, and should not need any changes and that was my primary goal.
